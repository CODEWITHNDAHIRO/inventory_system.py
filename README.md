Project: Supply Chain Inventory Logic

This module demonstrates how OOP can optimize supply chain operations.

Abstraction: Used an ABC to ensure all inventory items share a standard reporting interface.

Encapsulation: Protected the __items list within the Warehouse class to prevent unauthorized data manipulation.

Polymorphism: The get_inventory_report method behaves differently depending on whether an item is perishable or a standard asset.
